  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a journalist interested in health policy, health care delivery and housing. I'm currently a research assistant at the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at the Brown University Schol of Public Health. You can find my writing in The Wall Street Journal, Health Affairs, The Boston Globe and Gothamist.</p>
  <p>I graduated from Brown University in 2025 with a dual Sc.B. in Statistics and A.B. in Public Health. While at Brown, I was editor-in-chief of The Brown Daily Herald and interned at the National Institutes of Health. In my free time, I co-run a free <a href="https://copulaprogram.org/" target="_blank">summer research program</a> for high school students.</p>
